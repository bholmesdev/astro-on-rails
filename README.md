# README

This creates a Ruby on Rails project using Astro for views.

## Installation

First, follow the [Rails installation guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project-installing-rails) to ensure you have compatible versions of Ruby and Rails installed.

Once Ruby is set up, install packages / gems:

```bash
bundle install
```

Next, install JavaScript dependencies using the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Start the development server

Run `pnpm dev` in your terminal. This will start the Astro dev server at `http://localhost:4321`, and a Ruby on Rails server in the background. Be sure to open `http://localhost:4321` and _not_ the Rails server.
